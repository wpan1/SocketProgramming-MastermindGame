Welcome to Mastermind!

Mastermind is a two-player game consisting of a codemaker and a 
codebreaker. You are the codebreaker and I am the codemaker. I will 
secretly select a four letter code cosisting of the letters 
A, B, C, D, E and F with possible repetitions. Your job is to guess 
my secret code! After each guess you make, I'll provide a hint. The 
hint consists of two numbers. The first number is the number of 
letters correctly guessed in the correct position. The second number 
are parts of the code correctly guessed but not in the correct 
position. You continue to guess until you guess correctly. 
However, you only get ten guesses. 

Good Luck!
